      <p>You are given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree with <code>n</code> nodes where each <code>node</code> in the tree has <code>node.val</code> coins. There are <code>n</code> coins in total throughout the whole tree.</p>  <p>In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.</p>  <p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of moves required to make every node have <strong>exactly</strong> one coin</em>.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p> <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree1.png" style="width: 250px; height: 236px;" />  <strong>Input:</strong> root = [3,0,0] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 2 <strong>Explanation: </strong>From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p> <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree2.png" style="width: 250px; height: 236px;" />  <strong>Input:</strong> root = [0,3,0] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 3 <strong>Explanation: </strong>From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves]. Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li>The number of nodes in the tree is <code>n</code>.</li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100</code></li>  <li><code>0 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= n</code></li>  <li>The sum of all <code>Node.val</code> is <code>n</code>.</li> </ul>

Similar to above problem, start from leaf nodes, dfs update in reverse, so call dfs first. Postorder dfs

We return the offset of current_node. To calculate, we calculate offset.abs for left and right, as both offsets needs that many moves.

Leaf has offset of (coin-1), for its parent, l+r moves would be required. 
And resulting offset would be (coin -1 + left_reserve + right_reserve), reserve can be negative. Moves would be left_reserve.abs + right_reserve.abs
