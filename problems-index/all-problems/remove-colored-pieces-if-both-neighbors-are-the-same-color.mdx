      <p>There are <code>n</code> pieces arranged in a line, and each piece is colored either by <code>&#39;A&#39;</code> or by <code>&#39;B&#39;</code>. You are given a string <code>colors</code> of length <code>n</code> where <code>colors[i]</code> is the color of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> piece.</p>  <p>Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take <strong>alternating turns</strong> removing pieces from the line. In this game, Alice moves<strong> first</strong>.</p>  <ul>  <li>Alice is only allowed to remove a piece colored <code>&#39;A&#39;</code> if <strong>both its neighbors</strong> are also colored <code>&#39;A&#39;</code>. She is <strong>not allowed</strong> to remove pieces that are colored <code>&#39;B&#39;</code>.</li>  <li>Bob is only allowed to remove a piece colored <code>&#39;B&#39;</code> if <strong>both its neighbors</strong> are also colored <code>&#39;B&#39;</code>. He is <strong>not allowed</strong> to remove pieces that are colored <code>&#39;A&#39;</code>.</li>  <li>Alice and Bob <strong>cannot</strong> remove pieces from the edge of the line.</li>  <li>If a player cannot make a move on their turn, that player <strong>loses</strong> and the other player <strong>wins</strong>.</li> </ul>  <p>Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return <code>true</code><em> if Alice wins, or return </em><code>false</code><em> if Bob wins</em>.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> colors = &quot;AAABABB&quot; <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> true <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> A<u>A</u>ABABB -&gt; AABABB Alice moves first. She removes the second &#39;A&#39; from the left since that is the only &#39;A&#39; whose neighbors are both &#39;A&#39;.  Now it&#39;s Bob&#39;s turn. Bob cannot make a move on his turn since there are no &#39;B&#39;s whose neighbors are both &#39;B&#39;. Thus, Alice wins, so return true.   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> colors = &quot;AA&quot; <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> false <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> Alice has her turn first. There are only two &#39;A&#39;s and both are on the edge of the line, so she cannot move on her turn. Thus, Bob wins, so return false.   <p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> colors = &quot;ABBBBBBBAAA&quot; <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> false <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> ABBBBBBBA<u>A</u>A -&gt; ABBBBBBBAA Alice moves first. Her only option is to remove the second to last &#39;A&#39; from the right.  ABBBB<u>B</u>BBAA -&gt; ABBBBBBAA Next is Bob&#39;s turn. He has many options for which &#39;B&#39; piece to remove. He can pick any.  On Alice&#39;s second turn, she has no more pieces that she can remove. Thus, Bob wins, so return false.    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><code>1 &lt;=&nbsp;colors.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>  <li><code>colors</code>&nbsp;consists of only the letters&nbsp;<code>&#39;A&#39;</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>&#39;B&#39;</code></li> </ul>
