      <p>The <b>appeal</b> of a string is the number of <strong>distinct</strong> characters found in the string.</p>  <ul>  <li>For example, the appeal of <code>&quot;abbca&quot;</code> is <code>3</code> because it has <code>3</code> distinct characters: <code>&#39;a&#39;</code>, <code>&#39;b&#39;</code>, and <code>&#39;c&#39;</code>.</li> </ul>  <p>Given a string <code>s</code>, return <em>the <strong>total appeal of all of its <strong>substrings</strong>.</strong></em></p>  <p>A <strong>substring</strong> is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;abbca&quot; <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 28 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> The following are the substrings of &quot;abbca&quot;: - Substrings of length 1: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;a&quot; have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 5. - Substrings of length 2: &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;, &quot;bc&quot;, &quot;ca&quot; have an appeal of 2, 1, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 7. - Substrings of length 3: &quot;abb&quot;, &quot;bbc&quot;, &quot;bca&quot; have an appeal of 2, 2, and 3 respectively. The sum is 7. - Substrings of length 4: &quot;abbc&quot;, &quot;bbca&quot; have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6. - Substrings of length 5: &quot;abbca&quot; has an appeal of 3. The sum is 3.

      Consider each characters contribution in the final substrings, how many substrings will a char contribute to. For this we get left and right exts.

At a given idx, considering we always take contribution of the first char in a substring, so in "xabxb",  the first x is considered, last x isnt.
With this logic, for each char at idx, right options are all to the right, but left options are ones where this char is first, so idx - last_occurence of this char.
So, if at an idx, say the char is b, and prev is j, and next occ is k. 

When we go to k, the left will become k-j, as only in these starting points, will the char at k be a first char,  
and will contribute to the appeal of the substring.
