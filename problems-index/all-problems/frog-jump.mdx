      <p>A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.</p>  <p>Given a list of <code>stones</code>&nbsp;positions (in units) in sorted <strong>ascending order</strong>, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be <code>1</code> unit.</p>  <p>If the frog&#39;s last jump was <code>k</code> units, its next jump must be either <code>k - 1</code>, <code>k</code>, or <code>k + 1</code> units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> true <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> false <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><code>2 &lt;= stones.length &lt;= 2000</code></li>  <li><code>0 &lt;= stones[i] &lt;= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code></li>  <li><code>stones[0] == 0</code></li>  <li><code>stones</code>&nbsp;is sorted in a strictly increasing order.</li> </ul>

      From constraints, N^2 will work. For each stone, we can check if it can be reached from last stone. 
This can be reversed, from each stone, update the next stones that can be reached from there. 

First jump is always 1 unit. So, jump from 0 of 1 unit can always be made. Now, from here, 3 more jumps can be made, so from 1, update 1 + 0, 1+1, 1+2 positions for these 3 jumps. Now for the next stone, check if it can come from any previous stone or not. If it can, then update 3 more stones for the next jump. At any point if you reach last stone, true can be returned.

We have to update all possible jumps from previous stones. Based on if a jump can be made from a previous stone, the jump would be of diff units, and if it is, next jumps are diff-1, diff, diff+1 from i. So update those values.
