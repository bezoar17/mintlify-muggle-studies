      <p>You are given an integer <code>n</code>. There are <code>n</code> rooms numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>.</p>  <p>You are given a 2D integer array <code>meetings</code> where <code>meetings[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that a meeting will be held during the <strong>half-closed</strong> time interval <code>[start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>)</code>. All the values of <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</p>  <p>Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:</p>  <ol>  <li>Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the <strong>lowest</strong> number.</li>  <li>If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the <strong>same</strong> duration as the original meeting.</li>  <li>When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original <strong>start</strong> time should be given the room.</li> </ol>  <p>Return<em> the <strong>number</strong> of the room that held the most meetings. </em>If there are multiple rooms, return<em> the room with the <strong>lowest</strong> number.</em></p>  <p>A <strong>half-closed interval</strong> <code>[a, b)</code> is the interval between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> <strong>including</strong> <code>a</code> and <strong>not including</strong> <code>b</code>.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 0 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> - At time 0, both rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0. - At time 1, only room 1 is not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1. - At time 2, both rooms are being used. The third meeting is delayed. - At time 3, both rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed. - At time 5, the meeting in room 1 finishes. The third meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [5,10). - At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11). Both rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0.    <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 1 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> - At time 1, all three rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0. - At time 2, rooms 1 and 2 are not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1. - At time 3, only room 2 is not being used. The third meeting starts in room 2. - At time 4, all three rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed. - At time 5, the meeting in room 2 finishes. The fourth meeting starts in room 2 for the time period [5,10). - At time 6, all three rooms are being used. The fifth meeting is delayed. - At time 10, the meetings in rooms 1 and 2 finish. The fifth meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [10,12). Room 0 held 1 meeting while rooms 1 and 2 each held 2 meetings, so we return 1.     <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100</code></li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= meetings.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>  <li><code>meetings[i].length == 2</code></li>  <li><code>0 &lt;= start<sub>i</sub> &lt; end<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>  <li>All the values of <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</li> </ul>

      Maintain free rooms and busy rooms(min of end-time) in a min heap. If free room is not 0, assign it to next min from heap. If not, assign to the one from busy heap, and extend its end-time.
