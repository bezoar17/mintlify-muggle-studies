      <p>You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and <b>it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night</b>.</p>  <p>Given an integer array <code>nums</code> representing the amount of money of each house, return <em>the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight <b>without alerting the police</b></em>.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,3,1] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 4 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,7,9,3,1] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 12 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1). Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 100</code></li>  <li><code>0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 400</code></li> </ul>

      this is different from paint house, as there we had to choose every row, here we can skip in between if it favours us.


Calculate 2 states for each value, previous and current were skipped/robbed, and calculate those values.
