      <p>You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are <strong>arranged in a circle.</strong> That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and&nbsp;<b>it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night</b>.</p>  <p>Given an integer array <code>nums</code> representing the amount of money of each house, return <em>the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight <strong>without alerting the police</strong></em>.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,3,2] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 3 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,3,1] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 4 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.   <p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,3] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 3    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 100</code></li>  <li><code>0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 1000</code></li> </ul>
