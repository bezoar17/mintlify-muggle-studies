      <p>There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You are given a 2D integer array <code>classes</code>, where <code>classes[i] = [pass<sub>i</sub>, total<sub>i</sub>]</code>. You know beforehand that in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> class, there are <code>total<sub>i</sub></code> total students, but only <code>pass<sub>i</sub></code> number of students will pass the exam.</p>  <p>You are also given an integer <code>extraStudents</code>. There are another <code>extraStudents</code> brilliant students that are <strong>guaranteed</strong> to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each of the <code>extraStudents</code> students to a class in a way that <strong>maximizes</strong> the <strong>average</strong> pass ratio across <strong>all</strong> the classes.</p>  <p>The <strong>pass ratio</strong> of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam divided by the total number of students of the class. The <strong>average pass ratio</strong> is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.</p>  <p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> possible average pass ratio after assigning the </em><code>extraStudents</code><em> students. </em>Answers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual answer will be accepted.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> classes = [[1,2],[3,5],[2,2]], <code>extraStudents</code> = 2 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 0.78333 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> You can assign the two extra students to the first class. The average pass ratio will be equal to (3/4 + 3/5 + 2/2) / 3 = 0.78333.   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> classes = [[2,4],[3,9],[4,5],[2,10]], <code>extraStudents</code> = 4 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 0.53485    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><code>1 &lt;= classes.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>  <li><code>classes[i].length == 2</code></li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= pass<sub>i</sub> &lt;= total<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= extraStudents &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li> </ul>

      Ignore the denominator classes.count. Try to maximize the pass ratio sum. For all classes, given current p/t values, if a student is added it will change to p+1/t+1. Keep classes in a maxheap, with max change at top, add 1 student, and put the class back into the heap. Do this extra_students no. of times.
