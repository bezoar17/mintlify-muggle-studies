      <p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> <code>m x n</code> integer matrix <code>grid</code> and an integer <code>k</code>. You are currently at position <code>(0, 0)</code> and you want to reach position <code>(m - 1, n - 1)</code> moving only <strong>down</strong> or <strong>right</strong>.</p>  <p>Return<em> the number of paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by </em><code>k</code>. Since the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p> <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/13/image-20220813183124-1.png" style="width: 437px; height: 200px;" />  <strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[5,2,4],[3,0,5],[0,7,2]], k = 3 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 2 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> There are two paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by k. The first path highlighted in red has a sum of 5 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 18 which is divisible by 3. The second path highlighted in blue has a sum of 5 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 15 which is divisible by 3.   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p> <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/17/image-20220817112930-3.png" style="height: 85px; width: 132px;" />  <strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[0,0]], k = 5 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 1 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> The path highlighted in red has a sum of 0 + 0 = 0 which is divisible by 5.   <p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p> <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/12/image-20220812224605-3.png" style="width: 257px; height: 200px;" />  <strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[7,3,4,9],[2,3,6,2],[2,3,7,0]], k = 1 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 10 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> Every integer is divisible by 1 so the sum of the elements on every possible path is divisible by k.    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><code>m == grid.length</code></li>  <li><code>n == grid[i].length</code></li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= m * n &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>  <li><code>0 &lt;= grid[i][j] &lt;= 100</code></li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= 50</code></li> </ul>

      dp[i][j][mod], i,j,mod is paths which reach i,j with path-sum%k being mod,
each position has 2 options of arrival, to the next cell also there will be 2 more options from this cell. We have to maintain all sums, but all possible sums can be mapped to sum%k, and we dont care about actual sum values , but only sum%k.

Constraints is a give away of state, k is 50, m* n is 5* 10^4, total becomes 10^6. So 1 pass in 3D dp.
