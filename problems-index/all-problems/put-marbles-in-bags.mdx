      <p>You have <code>k</code> bags. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>weights</code> where <code>weights[i]</code> is the weight of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> marble. You are also given the integer <code>k.</code></p>  <p>Divide the marbles into the <code>k</code> bags according to the following rules:</p>  <ul>  <li>No bag is empty.</li>  <li>If the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> marble and <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> and <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> indices should also be in that same bag.</li>  <li>If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from <code>i</code> to <code>j</code> inclusively, then the cost of the bag is <code>weights[i] + weights[j]</code>.</li> </ul>  <p>The <strong>score</strong> after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the <code>k</code> bags.</p>  <p>Return <em>the <strong>difference</strong> between the <strong>maximum</strong> and <strong>minimum</strong> scores among marble distributions</em>.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> weights = [1,3,5,1], k = 2 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 4 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong>  The distribution [1],[3,5,1] results in the minimal score of (1+1) + (3+1) = 6.  The distribution [1,3],[5,1], results in the maximal score of (1+3) + (5+1) = 10.  Thus, we return their difference 10 - 6 = 4.   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> weights = [1, 3], k = 2 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 0 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> The only distribution possible is [1],[3].  Since both the maximal and minimal score are the same, we return 0.    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= weights.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= weights[i] &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li> </ul>

      weights needs to be split in k subarrays, so k-1 split points. Each split point at i contributes i, i+1 to weights. So, in a max config, we have highest k-1 values for {i,i+1} pairs, and in min config, the lowest k-1 values.

as we cant have bag1, bag2, bag1 again, for k bags, we are basically choosing k-1 idxs for split
for split at i in left bag, cost added is i, and i+1, for new bag
for largest, we want sum of largest k-1 pairs, and for min, smallest k-1 pairs.

Apart from edge cases of k==1, and k ==n.

```ruby title="Put Marbles in Bags" lines
# @param {Integer[]} weights
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Integer}
def put_marbles(weights, k)
  n = weights.size
  return 0 if k == 1 || n==k # only 1 way to distribute
  
  # as we cant have bag1, bag2, bag1 again, for n bags, we are basically choosing n-1 idxs for split
  # for split at i in left bag, cost added is i, and i+1, for new bag
  # n bags, 2n weights in cost, first and last are always in the bag, they dont make diff to max-min
  # for k=2, we choose 1 idx in between which will contribute i, and i+1 to cost
  # for largest, we want sum of largest k-1 pairs, and for min, smallest k-1 pairs

  pair_weights = (0...(n-1)).map {|i| weights[i] + weights[i+1] }.sort

  pair_weights.last(k-1).sum - pair_weights.first(k-1).sum
end
