      <p>Alice and Bob are playing a turn-based game on a field, with two lanes of flowers between them. There are <code>x</code> flowers in the first lane between Alice and Bob, and <code>y</code> flowers in the second lane between them.</p>  <p><img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/08/27/3021.png" style="width: 300px; height: 150px;" /></p>  <p>The game proceeds as follows:</p>  <ol>  <li>Alice takes the first turn.</li>  <li>In each turn, a player must choose either one of the lane&nbsp;and pick one flower from that side.</li>  <li>At the end of the turn, if there are no flowers left at all in either lane, the <strong>current</strong> player captures their opponent and wins the game.</li> </ol>  <p>Given two integers, <code>n</code> and <code>m</code>, the task is to compute the number of possible pairs <code>(x, y)</code> that satisfy the conditions:</p>  <ul>  <li>Alice must win the game according to the described rules.</li>  <li>The number of flowers <code>x</code> in the first lane must be in the range <code>[1,n]</code>.</li>  <li>The number of flowers <code>y</code> in the second lane must be in the range <code>[1,m]</code>.</li> </ul>  <p>Return <em>the number of possible pairs</em> <code>(x, y)</code> <em>that satisfy the conditions mentioned in the statement</em>.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> n = 3, m = 2 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 3 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> The following pairs satisfy conditions described in the statement: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1).   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> n = 1, m = 1 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 0 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> No pairs satisfy the conditions described in the statement.    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><code>1 &lt;= n, m &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li> </ul>

    <Card>
      x-&gt;[1,n] y-&gt;[1,m]; only when all flowers from both lane are gone, they win the game
 
If there was only 1 lane, then flower no. has to be odd for Alice to win the game.
Because there are 2 lanes, and both have to be exhausted anyway, sum of flowers should be odd.

So, given n,m how many odd pairs you can form. We can form 2 pairs, x-even & y-odd OR x-odd & y-even.
