      <p>You are given an array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day, and an integer <code>fee</code> representing a transaction fee.</p>  <p>Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.</p>  <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li>You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).</li>  <li>The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.</li> </ul>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 8 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> The maximum profit can be achieved by: - Buying at prices[0] = 1 - Selling at prices[3] = 8 - Buying at prices[4] = 4 - Selling at prices[5] = 9 The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 6    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= prices[i] &lt; 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>  <li><code>0 &lt;= fee &lt; 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li> </ul>

      Exactly same as buy and sell stock where we maintain 2 states, of having or not having stocks, but whenever we sell, we incur a fee, so just add that to the state change equation.
