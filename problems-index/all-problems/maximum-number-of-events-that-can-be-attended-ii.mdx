      <p>You are given an array of <code>events</code> where <code>events[i] = [startDay<sub>i</sub>, endDay<sub>i</sub>, value<sub>i</sub>]</code>. The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> event starts at <code>startDay<sub>i</sub></code><sub> </sub>and ends at <code>endDay<sub>i</sub></code>, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of <code>value<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an integer <code>k</code> which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.</p>  <p>You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the <strong>entire</strong> event. Note that the end day is <strong>inclusive</strong>: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.</p>  <p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum sum</strong> of values that you can receive by attending events.</em></p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>  <p><img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60048-pm.png" style="width: 400px; height: 103px;" /></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 7 <strong>Explanation: </strong>Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.  <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>  <p><img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60150-pm.png" style="width: 400px; height: 103px;" /></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,10]], k = 2 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 10 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.

      Attend max k strictly non-overlapping events and get max score.
Sort, so we can find next non-overlapping easily, now going from left to right, for each interval, simulate choices to include or exclude. If we include, we go to next non-overlapping, else we go to next in line overlapping or not.
