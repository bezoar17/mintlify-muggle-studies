      <p>You are given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.</p>  <p>Return <em>the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree</em>.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p> <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_01.png" style="width: 138px; height: 163px;" />  <strong>Input:</strong> root = [0,0,null,0,0] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 1 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p> <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png" style="width: 139px; height: 312px;" />  <strong>Input:</strong> root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 2 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li>The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 1000]</code>.</li>  <li><code>Node.val == 0</code></li> </ul>

      Postorder dfs. sub-tree state at a node can be
Below nodes are covered, camera is present here.
Below nodes are covered, camera is absent here -&gt; this node is not covered, covered.

We work our way up, ensure all below nodes are covered, and do necessary state changes.

Postorder DFS -&gt; https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/

For each node, make camera or skip. Similar problems.
