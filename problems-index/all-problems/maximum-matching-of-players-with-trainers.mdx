    <Card>
      <p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>players</code>, where <code>players[i]</code> represents the <strong>ability</strong> of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> player. You are also given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>trainers</code>, where <code>trainers[j]</code> represents the <strong>training capacity </strong>of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> trainer.</p>  <p>The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> player can <strong>match</strong> with the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> trainer if the player&#39;s ability is <strong>less than or equal to</strong> the trainer&#39;s training capacity. Additionally, the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> player can be matched with at most one trainer, and the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> trainer can be matched with at most one player.</p>  <p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of matchings between </em><code>players</code><em> and </em><code>trainers</code><em> that satisfy these conditions.</em></p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> players = [4,7,9], trainers = [8,2,5,8] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 2 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> One of the ways we can form two matchings is as follows: - players[0] can be matched with trainers[0] since 4 &lt;= 8. - players[1] can be matched with trainers[3] since 7 &lt;= 8. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of matchings that can be formed.   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> players = [1,1,1], trainers = [10] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 1 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> The trainer can be matched with any of the 3 players. Each player can only be matched with one trainer, so the maximum answer is 1.    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><code>1 &lt;= players.length, trainers.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= players[i], trainers[j] &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li> </ul>   <p><strong>Note:</strong> This question is the same as <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/description/" target="_blank"> 445: Assign Cookies.</a></p>
