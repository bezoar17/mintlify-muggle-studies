      <p>Given an integer array <code>arr</code> of <strong>distinct</strong> integers and an integer <code>k</code>.</p>  <p>A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. <code>arr[0]</code> and <code>arr[1]</code>). In each round of the game, we compare <code>arr[0]</code> with <code>arr[1]</code>, the larger integer wins and remains at position <code>0</code>, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins <code>k</code> consecutive rounds.</p>  <p>Return <em>the integer which will win the game</em>.</p>  <p>It is <strong>guaranteed</strong> that there will be a winner of the game.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 5 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> Let&#39;s see the rounds of the game: Round |       arr       | winner | win_count   1   | [2,1,3,5,4,6,7] | 2      | 1   2   | [2,3,5,4,6,7,1] | 3      | 1   3   | [3,5,4,6,7,1,2] | 5      | 1   4   | [5,4,6,7,1,2,3] | 5      | 2 So we can see that 4 rounds will be played and 5 is the winner because it wins 2 consecutive games.   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> arr = [3,2,1], k = 10 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> 3 <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> 3 will win the first 10 rounds consecutively.    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><code>2 &lt;= arr.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= arr[i] &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></code></li>  <li><code>arr</code> contains <strong>distinct</strong> integers.</li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li> </ul>

      we can just simulate the problem, as is and find the winner. But a small insight is that when a player loses, they never play again, if they are not the max_element. So simulate till we either reach k for a player or we reach max_element, after which max will win all rounds.

# @param {Integer[]} arr
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Integer}
def get_winner(arr, k)
  # if max element appears before we get a winner, it will win
  # a number before max can win k rounds before we reach max
  # but a number which is before max and loses, will never win
  # so simulate till either we get a winner or max_element
  max_elem = arr.max
  
  wins = 1; current_winner = [arr[0], arr[1]].max
