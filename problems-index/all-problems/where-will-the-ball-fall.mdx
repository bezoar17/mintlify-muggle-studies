      <p>You have a 2-D <code>grid</code> of size <code>m x n</code> representing a box, and you have <code>n</code> balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.</p>  <p>Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.</p>  <ul>  <li>A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and is represented in the grid as <code>1</code>.</li>  <li>A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner and is represented in the grid as <code>-1</code>.</li> </ul>  <p>We drop one ball at the top of each column of the box. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a &quot;V&quot; shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.</p>  <p>Return <em>an array </em><code>answer</code><em> of size </em><code>n</code><em> where </em><code>answer[i]</code><em> is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the </em><code>i<sup>th</sup></code><em> column at the top, or <code>-1</code><em> if the ball gets stuck in the box</em>.</em></p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>  <p><strong><img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/26/ball.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 385px;" /></strong></p>   <strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[1,1,1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]] <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> [1,-1,-1,-1,-1] <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> This example is shown in the photo.

    <Card>
        in a row 1,-1 is a pit(both cells will capture the ball) where ball will get stuck
  edge case is left and right columns of the grid, these are falls, where ball will escape
  mark the pit and falls, and then simulate for each position
	
	
we can modify grid to indicate pit/fall, make the value 0 indicating it,
information about further direction is lost, but thats okay, as any ball reaching here wont go further so no more info is needed anyway.

We can also directly simulate without any markings
