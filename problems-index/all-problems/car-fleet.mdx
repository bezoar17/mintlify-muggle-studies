      <p>There are <code>n</code> cars at given miles away from the starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile <code>target</code>.</p>  <p>You are given two integer arrays&nbsp;<code>position</code> and <code>speed</code>, both of length <code>n</code>, where <code>position[i]</code> is the starting mile of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car and <code>speed[i]</code> is the speed of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car in miles per hour.</p>  <p>A car cannot pass another car, but it can catch up and then travel next to it at the speed of the slower car.</p>  <p>A <strong>car fleet</strong> is a single car or a group of cars driving next to each other. The speed of the car fleet is the <strong>minimum</strong> speed of any car in the fleet.</p>  <p>If a car catches up to a car fleet at the mile <code>target</code>, it will still be considered as part of the car fleet.</p>  <p>Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.</p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>  <div class="example-block"> <p><strong>Input:</strong> <span class="example-io">target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]</span></p>  <p><br/> <strong>Output:</strong> <span class="example-io">3</span></p>  <p><br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li>The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.

      Similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/description/ 

If we sort by position, so any car to left of current car with slower speed, or that would take more time cant be part of fleet that the current car is heading.

So, if we process from the right hand side, each car which is not part of current fleet, is the leader of the new fleet, and the speed of that car is the speed of fleet, as it is the least speed that is speed of the fleet.
