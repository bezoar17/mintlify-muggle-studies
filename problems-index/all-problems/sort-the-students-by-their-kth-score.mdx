      <p>There is a class with <code>m</code> students and <code>n</code> exams. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> <code>m x n</code> integer matrix <code>score</code>, where each row represents one student and <code>score[i][j]</code> denotes the score the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> student got in the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> exam. The matrix <code>score</code> contains <strong>distinct</strong> integers only.</p>  <p>You are also given an integer <code>k</code>. Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the matrix) by their scores in the <code>k<sup>th</sup></code>&nbsp;(<strong>0-indexed</strong>) exam from the highest to the lowest.</p>  <p>Return <em>the matrix after sorting it.</em></p>   <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p> <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/11/30/example1.png" style="width: 600px; height: 136px;" />  <strong>Input:</strong> score = [[10,6,9,1],[7,5,11,2],[4,8,3,15]], k = 2 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> [[7,5,11,2],[10,6,9,1],[4,8,3,15]] <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> In the above diagram, S denotes the student, while E denotes the exam. - The student with index 1 scored 11 in exam 2, which is the highest score, so they got first place. - The student with index 0 scored 9 in exam 2, which is the second highest score, so they got second place. - The student with index 2 scored 3 in exam 2, which is the lowest score, so they got third place.   <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p> <img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/11/30/example2.png" style="width: 486px; height: 121px;" />  <strong>Input:</strong> score = [[3,4],[5,6]], k = 0 <br/> <strong>Output:</strong> [[5,6],[3,4]] <br/> <strong>Explanation:</strong> In the above diagram, S denotes the student, while E denotes the exam. - The student with index 1 scored 5 in exam 0, which is the highest score, so they got first place. - The student with index 0 scored 3 in exam 0, which is the lowest score, so they got second place.    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li><code>m == score.length</code></li>  <li><code>n == score[i].length</code></li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 250</code></li>  <li><code>1 &lt;= score[i][j] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>  <li><code>score</code> consists of <strong>distinct</strong> integers.</li>  <li><code>0 &lt;= k &lt; n</code></li> </ul>
